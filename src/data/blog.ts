# How Much Does a Website Cost in Portugal in 2026?

This is, by far, the question we receive the most. And the honest answer is: **it depends** on what you need and how you acquire it.

## The Market in 2026

In Portugal, the options for having a professional website range from free (with many limitations) to €20,000+ for enterprise-level projects. Let’s break down each option.

## Option 1: Do It Yourself (DIY)

Platforms like Wix, Squarespace, or WordPress.com allow you to build a website without knowing how to code. Pricing typically ranges from €10–30/month.

**The problem:** The result rarely looks truly professional. Templates are used by thousands of businesses, SEO capabilities are limited, and the learning curve consumes time you could invest in your business.

## Option 2: Freelancer

A freelancer in Portugal typically charges between €500 and €3,000 for a website, depending on complexity.

**The problem:** You pay everything upfront. If you need changes later, you pay more. If the freelancer disappears, you lose support. Many freelancers also work part-time with shifting priorities.

## Option 3: Traditional Agency

An established agency may charge between €2,000 and €15,000+ for a website. This usually includes strategy, design, development, and some level of ongoing support.

**The problem:** It’s a significant investment for SMEs and local businesses. ROI can take time to materialize.

## Option 4: Monthly Subscription (The Modern Model)

This is the model PresençaPro adopts: you pay a monthly fee that includes everything — design, development, hosting, domain, maintenance, and support.

**Advantages:**
- No upfront investment
- Predictable monthly cost
- Continuous support
- A website that is always updated and secure

Our plans start at **€25/month**.

## So Which Model Is Best?

For most small and medium-sized businesses in Portugal, the subscription model is the smartest option. It avoids upfront risk, guarantees ongoing support, and keeps costs accessible.

If you run a business with very specific needs (robust e-commerce, portal, custom app), a traditional agency or dedicated developer may make more sense.

## Conclusion

There is no universal answer. But if you are starting out or want to professionalize your online presence without spending a fortune, the subscription model is often the most sensible choice in 2026.

# Website vs Instagram: Which Generates More Leads?

It’s a debate we hear constantly: *"Do I really need a website? My Instagram is doing well."*

Short answer: you need both — but for different reasons.

## What Instagram Does Well

Instagram is a platform for discovery and community. It’s excellent for:

- Building a strong visual brand presence
- Showing behind-the-scenes content
- Reaching new audiences through Reels and hashtags
- Creating closer relationships with customers

## What Instagram Cannot Do

Here’s the problem: **you don’t own Instagram**.

The algorithm changes constantly. On average, your posts reach less than 5% of your followers. If Instagram suspends your account or changes its rules, you lose the audience you built.

Additionally, Instagram is not a search engine. If someone searches "hairdresser in Braga" on Google, they won’t find your Instagram — they’ll find a website.

## What a Website Can Do That Instagram Cannot

1. **Local SEO:** Appear on Google Maps and search results
2. **Credibility:** 84% of consumers consider businesses with websites more trustworthy
3. **Conversion:** A well-designed website converts better than an Instagram profile
4. **Full control:** Your website belongs to you; Instagram does not
5. **Real analytics:** You know exactly where your leads come from

## Data That Matters

Across the websites we manage, on average:

- 40% of leads come from Google search
- 25% from Google Maps
- 20% from direct referrals
- Only 15% from social media

## The Ideal Strategy

**Instagram** attracts attention and builds brand awareness.

**Your website** converts that attention into real clients, ranks on Google, and serves as your long-term digital asset.

It’s not one or the other — it’s both working together. Instagram attracts, your website converts.

# Local SEO: How to Rank on Google in Your City

If you run a local business in Portugal — restaurant, clinic, shop, service provider — local SEO is likely the highest-return digital marketing strategy available.

When someone searches "dentist in Aveiro" or "Chinese restaurant Porto", do you appear? If not, you are losing customers every single day.

## What Is Local SEO?

Local SEO is the set of strategies that make your business appear in geographic search results — both on Google Maps and in organic search listings.

## 1. Google Business Profile: The Starting Point

The **Google Business Profile** (formerly Google My Business) is completely free and forms the foundation of local visibility.

You must:
- Create and verify your profile
- Fill in all information (opening hours, phone, website, category)
- Add high-quality photos regularly
- Respond to all reviews (positive and negative)
- Publish weekly updates

## 2. NAP Consistency

NAP stands for Name, Address, Phone. Your business name, address, and phone number must be **exactly identical** everywhere: Google, Facebook, your website, directories.

Any inconsistency confuses Google and hurts your ranking.

## 3. Your Website with Local SEO

Your website should include:

- A page title with the city: "Dentist in Aveiro | Dr. Costa"
- An About page with address and service area
- LocalBusiness schema markup
- Embedded Google Map
- Natural mentions of city and neighborhood in the content

## 4. Reviews: The Engine of Local SEO

Google reviews are a critical ranking factor. 50+ reviews with 4.5+ stars put you ahead of 90% of competitors.

How to get more reviews:
- Ask satisfied clients directly
- Send them a direct review link
- Add a QR code in your physical location

## 5. Local Directory Citations

Register your business on: Yellow Pages, Sapo, Yelp, TripAdvisor (if relevant), and industry-specific directories.

## Expected Results

With a consistent strategy:
- 3 months: Top 10 for less competitive local searches
- 6 months: Appear in the Local Pack (the top 3 map results)
- 12 months: Local dominance for primary keywords

Local SEO is a marathon, not a sprint — but the results are durable and essentially free.
